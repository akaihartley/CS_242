       " 'Infrared Behavior of Three-Point Functions in Landau Gauge Yang-Mills Theory Markus Huber\\n1. Infrared Behavior\\nMany non-perturbative aspects of Yang-Mills theory are encoded in the infrared (IR) behav-\\nior of its Green functions. For very small momenta below the intrinsic scale LQCD they can be\\ndescribed by power laws. This scaling solution [ 1] is in accordance with the scenarios for conﬁne-\\nment of Gribov-Zwanziger and Kugo-Ojima. The general expression for the so-called IR exponent\\nof an arbitrary Green function with mgluon and 2 nghost legs under the assumption that all mo-\\nmenta go to zero uniformly is [ 2]\\nd2n;m= (n\\x00m)k+ (1\\x00n)\\x12d\\n2\\x002\\x13\\n: (1.1)\\nThis formula is valid in d=2;3;4 dimensions for the corresponding values of k. As it is clear that\\nwe can have more than one independent momentum for vertex functions, the question arises what\\nhappens when only one of these goes to zero? Interestingly it turns out that additional divergences\\ncan occur that do not change the uniform solution [ 3].\\nFor the calculation of the three-point vertices we used the known power laws for the propaga-\\ntors and the following truncations for the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), which is motivated\\nby ghost dominance in the IR [ 1,4]:\\n=IR-2\\n,\\n=IR+ .\\nFor the dressed ghost-gluon vertex we used the bare one, justiﬁed by a simple argument of\\nTaylor [ 5], which is supported by lattice simulations [ 6] and the DSE solution [ 7]. The truncation\\nconsiders only the ﬁrst order of the skeleton expansion. For more details see [ 8].\\n2. Three-point integral\\nThe ghost-triangle diagram of the three-gluon vertex is decomposed in the IR into ten ten-\\nsorsti\\nmnr(p1;p2;p3)and ten corresponding dressing functions Ei(p1;p2;p3). The applied tensor\\ndecomposition [ 9] reveals that only ten instead of the expected fourteen scalar functions Eiand\\ntensors ti\\nmnrare necessary. The former consist of massless three-point integrals,\\nZddq\\n(2p)d1\\n((q+p1)2)n1((q\\x00p2)2)n2(q2)n3; (2.1)\\nwhere n1,n2andn3are non-integer numbers. We employed the Negative Dimensions Integration\\nMethod (NDIM) which yields a full analytic solution in terms of Appell’s series F4. Using several\\ndifferent analytic continuations we can calculate the momentum dependence of the diagram for\\narbitrary d. As the variables of the Appell’s series are the momentum ratios p2\\n1=p2\\n3andp2\\n2=p2\\n3we\\nplot the scalars Eifrom the tensor decomposition as functions of p2\\n1andp2\\n2with p2\\n3ﬁxed.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe primary diﬃculty in solving the Schr¨ odinger equa-\\ntion for many-electron systems arises from the presence\\nof the electron-electron interaction, which results in a\\nproblem non-separable in the electron coordinates. Con-\\nﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations use an expansion\\nof the many-body wave function in conﬁguration state\\nfunctions (CSF) given by spin coupled sums of determi-\\nnants built from single-particle orbitals. One of the cen-\\ntral diﬃculties for the convergence of the CI expansion\\nis thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb\\ninteraction at small electron-electron separations [1–10 ].\\nThe many-body wave function must have an appropriate\\ncusp at electron coalescences so that the inﬁnite Coulomb\\ninteraction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di-\\nvergence of the kinetic energy [11].\\nIt is often stated in the literature that failure of the\\nCI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp, i.e.\\nthe short-range part of the Coulomb hole, leads to a slow\\nconvergence in the energy with respect to the number\\nof CSF’s [3]. While this has been shown [2,5] in the\\nasymptotic regime (i.e. very large angular momentum l\\nand energy errors of the order of 10−6Hartree), it is not\\nclear that it applies in the practical regime (mHartree\\naccuracy) for multi-electron systems.\\nExplicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic dis-\\ntance (r 12methods) [12,4] or the use of correlated (gem-\\ninal) Gaussian basis functions [13] signiﬁcantly improve\\nthe convergence of a CI calculation. For the helium atom,\\nthe inclusion of r 12terms [5] yields an expansion in partial\\nwaves converging asymtotically as l−6or better, instead\\nof a slow l−3, where lis the maximum angular momentum\\nin the expansion. Baker et al.[14] also showed that using\\nbasis functions with the same analytic structure as the\\ntrue wave function (depending on powers and logarithms\\nofr12) leads to a reduced expansion length. The suc-\\ncess of methods explicitly including r12terms has beenattributed to their correct description of the short-range\\npart of the interaction.\\nA completely diﬀerent point of view, taken by Gilbert\\nin 1963 [15], is that the diﬃculty of CI wave functions in\\ndescribing short-range eﬀects of the cusp are energeticall y\\nunimportant and that the beneﬁt of the explicitly corre-\\nlated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole, with a\\nsize on the order of the atomic orbitals, is much easier to\\ndescribe in terms of interelectronic coordinates. Gilbert ’s\\nsuggestion appears to have received little attention and\\nthe idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and\\nremoving the cusp altogether will automatically lead to\\nan improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter-\\nature [16,9]. However, no systematic studies of the eﬀect\\nof the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level\\nof interest for chemical accuracy (1 mHartree for total\\nenergies) have been presented.\\nIn this paper, we explore whether a signiﬁcant im-\\nprovement in the convergence of the CI expansion is\\nobtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one\\nwhich has a smooth and ﬁnite electron-electron interac-\\ntion (pseudo-interaction) at short distances and, conse-\\nquently, smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps.\\nSurprisingly, in calculations for the He and Be atoms,\\nwe ﬁnd that removing the divergence of the Coulomb\\npotential at electron-electron coalescences does not sig-\\nniﬁcantly reduce the length of the CI expansion, thereby\\nsubstantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert [15]\\nthat the slow convergence should be attributed to dif-\\nﬁculties in describing, not the interelectron cusp, but\\nthe intermediate-range electronic correlation. The poor\\ntreatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is\\nnot a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on\\nthe total energy. To further conﬁrm this result, we calcu-\\nlate the energy within quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for\\nthe true electron-electron interaction with accurate wave\\nfunctions which explicitly contain interelectronic coord i-\\nnates, and then deliberately remove the short-range cor-\\n1',\n",
       " 'relation term related to the cusp, keeping other parts\\nof the wave function unchanged. We ﬁnd that the re-\\nmoval of the cusp has a very small eﬀect on the vari-\\national energy. Finally, we demonstrate that the con-\\nvergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of\\nangular momentum in the range practical for many ap-\\nplications ( l <6) is largely unaﬀected by the smoothing\\nof the electron cusps. Therefore, the angular momentum\\nconvergence numerically observed by other authors [7] is\\nrelated to problems associated with intermediate range\\ncorrelations, not the cusp region as such.\\nIn Sec. II, we describe the pseudopotential used for\\nthe electron-electron interaction and brieﬂy present the\\nQMC and CI methods. In Sec. III, we report the QMC\\nand CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and\\npseudo electron interaction. In Appendices A and B,\\nwe discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the\\nelectron pseudo-interaction, and in Appendix C we deﬁne\\na short-range correlation term which can be associated\\nwith it. In Appendix D, we brieﬂy discuss the evaluation\\nof two-electron integrals for the pseudo-interaction.\\nII. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\\nA. Electron-electron Pseudo-interaction\\nWhen modifying the short-distance electron-electron\\ninteraction, we wish to keep the intermediate- and long-\\nrange correlation properties of the many-body eigen-\\nstates unchanged. This will allow us to isolate systemati-\\ncally the eﬀects of the short-range cusp-like behaviour in\\nthe wave function. To achieve this, our new (smooth) in-\\nteraction should ideally have electron-electron scatteri ng\\nproperties identical to the true interaction for all ener-\\ngies. If this were the case, all many-electron eigenvalues\\nwould be identical for both interactions. While this ideal\\ncannot be exactly realized, we expect that a potential\\nwith the same scattering properties as the true interac-\\ntion over a suﬃciently wide range of scattering energies\\nwill give many-electron eigenvalues very close to the true\\nones.\\nThis goal for electron-electron scattering is analogous\\nto the problem of electron-ion scattering addressed in the\\nwell-established pseudopotential method [17]. In that ap-\\nproach, the aim is to produce a smooth electron-ion po-\\ntential which reproduces the single-particle eigenvalues\\nof the true system over a range of energies, and has the\\nsame single-particle wave functions outside some suitably\\nchosen cut-oﬀ radius rc. Such pseudopotentials are gen-\\nerated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a\\nhigh level of accuracy in molecules and solids. In solids,\\nthe smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con-\\nvergence of plane-wave expansions for single-particle or-\\nbitals [18].\\nFollowing the success of norm-conserving pseudopo-\\ntential methods in the context of the electron-ion scat-0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\\nr (a.u.)0246810interaction energy (Hartree)Vps interaction\\nVerf interaction\\nCoulomb interaction\\nFIG. 1. Norm-conserving electron pseudo-interaction\\n(solid line) and smooth interaction Verf(dashed line), each\\nwith a cut-oﬀ radius rc= 0.25 a.u. (indicated by a vertical\\ndotted line), and the true 1 /rinteraction (dash-dot line), as\\nfunctions of the electron separation r.\\ntering problem, we generate a norm-conserving pseudo-\\ninteraction for the two-electron scattering problem,\\nwhich will replace the true e2/relectron-electron interac-\\ntion inside a cut-oﬀ radius rc. Since the electron-electron\\ninteraction is repulsive and has no bound states for an\\nisolated pair of electrons, we use, with some minor mod-\\niﬁcations, the generalized norm-conserving method de-\\nvised by Hamann [19] to generate pseudopotentials for\\nelectron-ion interactions at unbound, scattering state en -\\nergies. The numerical details of this approach are pre-\\nsented in Appendix A.\\nIn Fig. 1, we show a pseudo-interaction potential Vps\\ngenerated by this approach, along with the true e2/rin-\\nteraction and a smooth but not norm-conserving inter-\\naction, Verf(r) =e2erf(r/rc)/r, as used by Savin and\\ncoworkers [20] in a diﬀerent context. In Appendix B, the\\naccuracy of such scattering potentials in reproducing the\\nexact eigenstate energies is analyzed qualitatively using\\nﬁrst-order perturbation theory. In Appendix C, we de-\\nﬁne a short-range inter-electronic correlation term, whic h\\ncan be directly related to the replacement of the divergent\\nCoulomb interaction with a smooth norm-conserving in-\\nteraction.\\nB. Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations\\nWe employ QMC methods to determine accurate en-\\nergies both for the Coulomb and the pseudo-interaction.\\nThe wave functions Ψ used in QMC are of the form given\\nin Ref. [21] and explicitly depend on the inter-electronic\\n2',\n",

[21]. For\\nthe pseudo-interaction calculations, the Bterm is omit-\\nted. The parameters in the determinant and Jastrow\\nfactor are optimized within QMC using the variance min-\\nimisation method [22] and the accuracy is tested at the\\nvariational level. The wave function is then used in dif-\\nfusion Monte Carlo (DMC), which produces the best en-\\nergy within the ﬁxed-node approximation (i.e. the lowest-\\nenergy state with the same nodes as the trial wave func-\\ntion).\\nFor a given interaction, this method yields the ex-\\nact eigenvalue (within statistical sampling noise) for the\\nground state of the He isoelectronic series since the sin-\\nglet ground state wave function of a two-electron system\\nis nodeless. For He, only one determinant is used in the\\nwave function. For the Be atom, the 2s and 2p conﬁgura-\\ntions are included in the determinantal part of the wave\\nfunction and DMC gives the best energy subject to the\\nﬁxed-node condition. To isolate the eﬀect of the pseudo-\\ninteraction from the ﬁxed-node approximation, we keep\\nthe nodal structure of the wave function ﬁxed while mod-\\nifying the electron-electron interaction.\\nC. Conﬁguration Interaction Calculations\\nThe CI calculations are performed using the Monte\\nCarlo conﬁguration interaction (MCCI) method [23,24].\\nIn a MCCI calculation, a coeﬃcient threshold cminis de-\\nﬁned, conﬁgurations are randomly generated, and, after\\na variational calculation, coeﬃcients of magnitude be-\\nlowcminare rejected. This procedure is repeated until\\na desired degree of convergence in the CI calculation is\\nachieved. A full CI (FCI) calculation can be obtained for\\ncmin= 0. The fact that the MCCI procedure does not\\nrely on a pre-selection of CSF’s makes it well-suited for\\nour study: the dynamical selection of conﬁgurations al-\\nlows for rejection of CSF’s which may no longer be needed\\nwith the smooth electron interaction.For use in the CI approach, the pseudo-interaction Vps\\nis represented (in Hartree atomic units) as a sum of the\\nsmooth function VerfplusnGGaussian terms, as follows:\\nVps(r) =erf(r/rc)\\nr+nG/summationdisplay\\ni=1ciexp(−dir2). (3)\\nThis reproduces the 1 /rtail of the Coulomb interaction\\nand the smooth, ﬁnite form of the pseudo-interaction at\\nshort distances. The parameters cianddiare found by\\nleast-squares ﬁtting (for radii r <3rc) to the numerical\\npotential, generated as described in Appendix A. For\\nthe CI results presented below, the potential was ﬁtted\\nusing nG= 9. QMC calculations of the He atom energy\\nwith the numerical potential and with the ﬁtted potential\\nshow a negligible diﬀerence (less than 0 .02 mHartree for\\nall values of rc<1 a.u.).\\nEvaluation of the pseudo-interaction Vps(r) can be im-\\nplemented in codes for Gaussian integral calculation since\\nit is possible to compute the two-body matrix elements\\nboth of exp( −d r2) and erf( r/rc)/rin the CI basis. Ma-\\ntrix elements of the interaction erf( r/rc)/rfor all s-type\\nbasis functions have already been given in Ref. [20]. For\\nboth types of interaction, a simple modiﬁcation to the\\nintegral codes is possible if the standard two-electron in-\\ntegrals are calculated using the method of Rys quadra-\\nture [25]. Details of two-body integral evaluation with\\nthe modiﬁed form of the electron interaction are given in\\nAppendix D.\\nIII. He AND Be ATOMIC ENERGIES WITH\\nPSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\\nTo test the impact of the interelectron cusp on the en-\\nergy, we calculate the total energies of He and Be atoms,\\nreplacing the true 1 /relectron interaction with the norm-\\nconserving pseudo-interaction Vps(r), generated for var-\\nious values of the cut-oﬀ radius rc. For comparison,\\nwe also present results for the smooth but not norm-\\nconserving potential Verf(r) = erf( r/rc)/r. The results\\nin this section are obtained from QMC and CI calcula-\\ntions.\\nA. Ground State of the He atom\\nIn Fig. 2, we show the singlet ground state energies of\\nthe He atom calculated with a norm-conserving electron-\\nelectron interaction Vpsgenerated as in Sec. II, for various\\nvalues of the cut-oﬀ radius rc. The values obtained from\\nQMC (exact) calculations are shown. We also plot the\\nenergies calculated using the Verf(r) interaction. The hor-\\nizontal line indicates the exact energy E0=−2.903724\\nHartree for the true Coulomb interaction [26].\\nThe calculated QMC energies for VpsandVerfin\\nFig. 2 are ﬁtted with polynomial expansions of the form:\\n3',\n",

As discussed\\nin Appendix B, any potential which diﬀers from the ex-\\nact 1/rinteraction would be expected, from ﬁrst order\\nperturbation theory, to converge at least quadratically in\\nrcto the exact energy E0for small rc. Since Verfis not\\nexplicitly constructed to eliminate ﬁrst order errors in\\nVerf(r)−1/r, quadratic convergence is seen for Verfand\\nthe ﬁtting parameters are: a=−0.3279, b=−0.3839,\\nc= 0.6758, d=−0.2622, and e= 0. On the other\\nhand, the norm-conserving pseudo-interaction construc-\\ntion of Sec. II A explicitly ensures that the ﬁrst-order\\nperturbation correction to the energy is zero. The He\\nground state energy as a function of rcusing Vpscan\\nindeed be ﬁtted without the quadratic term, and even\\nthe cubic term proves to be small, the polynomial coef-\\nﬁcients being: a= 0,b= 0.0188, c=−0.1023, d= 0,\\nande= 0.0280. For He, the energies obtained using\\nVps(r) are within 1 mHartree of the energy computed\\nwith the true Coulomb interaction for values of rc<0.4\\na.u. Since the typical electron-electron distance in the\\nHe ground state is of the order of 1 a.u., these results in-\\ndicate that the ﬁrst peak of the electron pair-distribution\\nfunction provides a good measure of how large a cut-oﬀ\\nradius rcmay be used to obtain accurate total energies\\nwithVps(r):rcshould be approximately half the radius\\nat which this ﬁrst peak occurs. The same criterion for\\nthe largest allowed rcvalue was found to hold for other\\nsystems (not shown), viz. the He triplet state, the He\\nisoelectronic series, and multi-electron atoms. In a qual-itative way, this condition is similar to the criterion used\\nin the generation of electron-ion pseudopotentials, where\\nthe cut-oﬀ radius is chosen to be inside the peak of the\\nvalence electron density.\\nAlso shown in Fig. 2 are the variational energies (with\\nthe true Coulomb electron-electron interaction) obtained\\nfor the He ground state by removing the electron cusps\\nfrom the accurate trial wave function which was deter-\\nmined by variance minimization for use in the DMC cal-\\nculations, as speciﬁed in Eq. C1. This trial wave function\\nincludes considerable variational freedom in the interele c-\\ntronic terms and obtains 100% of the correlation energy.\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, removal of the cusp out to radii\\nof 0.5 a.u. causes little degradation of the quality of the\\nenergy obtained with this wave function. Thus the suc-\\ncess of interelectronic terms in obtaining good variationa l\\nenergies is not primarily due to their description of the\\nshort-range cusp behaviour.\\nThis trend is further borne out when we look at\\nthe convergence of partial CI expansions within a given\\nsingle-particle basis set for the MCCI method. The CI\\ncalculations were performed with the correlation consis-\\ntent polarized valence double-zeta (cc-pVDZ), triple-zet a\\n(cc-pVTZ), quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) and quintuple-\\nzeta (cc-pV5Z) basis sets of Dunning [27] with the elec-\\ntron interaction Vpsfor various values of rc. All four\\nbasis sets show similar behaviour and we present only\\nthe cc-pVQZ results in detail. Table I shows the correla-\\ntion energy obtained as a function of cut-oﬀ radius rcfor\\nvarious values of the expansion coeﬃcient threshold cmin.\\nThe full CI result is obtained when cmin= 0.0. For larger\\nvalues of the cut-oﬀ radius rc(upper rows of table), the\\ntotal correlation energy is smaller, as the variation of the\\ninteraction Vpsbecomes smaller around the typical sepa-\\nration distance of the electrons. However, the fraction of\\nthe correlation energy which is recovered at a given CI\\nthreshold level cmindepends little on the value of rc.\\nFig. 3 shows the number of CSF’s in the CI expan-\\nsion as a function of cut-oﬀ radius rcfor various values\\nof the expansion coeﬃcient threshold cmin. For values of\\ncmin>3×10−2, one is quickly reduced to a few CSF’s\\nand ﬁnally to the Hartree-Fock solution. As with the cor-\\nrelation energies, for a given threshold cmin, the number\\nof CSF’s shows relatively little change for values of rcbe-\\ntween 0 and 0.95. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that\\nthe typical electron-electron separation is 1 a.u. and that\\na cut-oﬀ radius rc= 0.95 represents a very smooth inter-\\naction. Thus, removal of electron cusps does not result\\nin a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of contributing\\nconﬁgurations in the CI expansion.\\nWe next demonstrate that removal of the electron cusp\\ndoes not signiﬁcantly change the convergence properties\\nof CI expansions as the highest angular momentum quan-\\ntum number is increased in the single particle basis sets.\\nIn Fig. 4, FCI energies for He are displayed against in-\\ncreasing basis set size in the correlation consistent serie s\\nfrom Dunning, and hence increasing angular momentum\\nnumber in the basis.

We have also compared the variational en-\\nergies of highly accurate wave functions containing r12\\nterms, where the cusp condition is exactly satisﬁed, with\\nthe energy for the same wave functions, from which the\\ncusp has been deliberately removed out to a given radius.\\nThe main result of our study is that a description of\\nthe electron cusp as such is nota limiting factor in cal-\\nculating correlation eﬀects with conﬁguration interactio n\\nmethods at the mHartree level of accuracy. We are led\\nto this conclusion since the replacement of the diver-\\ngent Coulomb interaction with a ﬁnite interaction leaves\\nthe convergence properties largely unchanged. The slow\\nconvergence of CI expansions in this energy range must\\nbe attributed to medium-range correlations, which are\\npresent for both types of electron interaction. The results\\nobtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate\\nvariational wave functions support this conclusion, show-\\ning that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically\\nimportant. This is found, even when cusp-like behaviour\\nis removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec-\\ntronic separation.\\nWhen describing correlation eﬀects with explicit r12\\nmethods, it is a mistaken notion to assign the improve-\\nment in convergence to their ability to describe the short-range cusp. Rather, the improvement in convergence at\\nthe mHartree level must be understood in terms of a\\nbetter description of medium-range correlations when ex-\\npressed in interelectronic coordinates. This fact must be\\nconsidered when developing theoretical treatments of the\\nelectronic correlation problem.\\nV. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe wish to thank D. R. Hamann for stimulating discus-\\nsions.

In Hartree atomic units, the\\ninteraction potential is V(r) = 1/rand the reduced mass\\nis 1/2. The radial Schr¨ odinger equation for the relative\\nmotion of two electrons is then\\n−d2ul\\ndr2+/parenleftbiggl(l+ 1)\\nr2+ (V−ǫl)/parenrightbigg\\nul= 0, (A1)\\nwhere ul(r) isrtimes the wave function in the relative\\ncoordinates, with angular momentum land energy ǫl(the\\nkinetic energy of the separated electrons in the centre of\\nmass frame).\\nIn the generation of a pseudopotential, the true po-\\ntential and pseudopotential become identical outside a\\nsuitably chosen cut-oﬀ radius rcand are constructed to\\nhave identical scattering phase shifts and energy deriva-\\ntive of the phase shift at a reference energy ǫl. A smooth\\npseudo wave function ups(r) is generated numerically to\\nensure “norm-conservation”, i.e. ups(R∞) =ul(R∞) and\\n/integraldisplayR∞\\n0ups(r)2dr=/integraldisplayR∞\\n0ul(r)2dr , (A2)\\nfor all R∞>> r c. In practice, we choose R∞∼2.5rc,\\nas in Ref. [19]. Given ups, a smooth, ﬁnite pseudopo-\\ntential Vpsis generated by inversion of the Schr¨ odinger\\nEq. A1 for r < R ∞, with ulandVsubstituted by upsand\\nVps, respectively. We follow the steps exactly as given in\\n7',\n",
       " 'Sec. II of Ref. [19], except where the reduced mass en-\\nters in the ﬁnal inversion, slightly modifying Eq. 12 of\\nHamann’s work.\\nIn the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, dif-\\nferent scattering potentials are often generated for diﬀer -\\nent values of the angular momentum l. The full many-\\nbody wave function is anti-symmetric with respect to ex-\\nchange of any two electrons. Thus, if the two electrons\\nhave parallel spin, the orbital part of the wave function\\nmust have odd parity and the allowed angular momentum\\nlmust be odd. Thus, the dominant parallel-spin scat-\\ntering has l= 1. For singlet (anti-parallel) scattering,\\nthe orbital part is symmetric and lmust be even, with\\ndominant allowed angular momentum l= 0. Following\\nthe usual pseudopotential approach, we might then ex-\\npect to generate a parallel-spin scattering potential usin g\\nl= 1 and an anti-parallel-spin scattering potential using\\nl= 0. In practice, we ﬁnd that the l= 0 potential gives\\ngood scattering for both angular momenta and the use\\nof separate parallel- and anti-parallel-spin potentials i s\\nunnecessary.\\nSince ǫlis positive, the wave function will oscillate for\\nlarge r, and if a node occurs for r < R ∞, the inver-\\nsion of the Schr¨ odinger equation will fail. Thus, the joint\\nrequirements, that rcbe suﬃciently large to produce a\\nsmooth pseudo-interaction and that R∞>∼2.5rc, eﬀec-\\ntively limit the maximum reference energy ǫlat which\\nthe pseudo-interaction construction is possible.\\nWe ﬁnd that the pseudo-interaction is transferable (i.e.\\nhas very similar scattering strength to the true interac-\\ntion) for energies over a wide range about the reference\\nenergy ǫl, as found previously for electron-ion pseudopo-\\ntentials. In particular, we ﬁnd that transferability is bes t\\nfor energies less than the reference energy at which the\\npseudopotential was generated. This would suggest that\\nthe best reference energy to use is the largest energy\\ncompatible with the procedure for inversion of the radial\\nSchr¨ odinger equation, a choice conﬁrmed by calculations\\nof many-body eigenstates using pseudo-interaction po-\\ntentials generated with diﬀerent values of the reference\\nenergy.\\nAPPENDIX B: FIRST ORDER PERTURBATION\\nANALYSIS OF PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\\nIn this Appendix, we consider the ﬁrst-order error\\nin the energy expected for a typical, arbitrary smooth\\nelectron-electron potential which is equal to the exact in-\\nteraction 1 /routside some (adjustable) cut-oﬀ radius rc.\\nWe will assume that the potential is (at least approxi-\\nmately) of the form\\nVrc(r) =1\\nrcU(r/rc) (B1)\\nwhere U(r/rc) is some universal function independent\\nofrc.

However,\\nfor an arbitrary smooth interaction (such as Verf),Kwill\\nnot be zero.\\nAPPENDIX C: SHORT-RANGE CORRELATION\\nTERM OBTAINED FROM NORM-CONSERVING\\nPOTENTIAL\\nIn the generation of the norm-conserving potential dis-\\ncussed in Appendix A, we obtained a pseudo wave func-\\ntionups(r), which is a solution to the radial Schr¨ odinger\\nequation at the scattering energy ǫlfor the pseudo-\\ninteraction, and the wave function ul(r), which is the\\ncorresponding solution for the true Coulomb interaction.\\nThe ratio Jsr=ul/upsof these two functions has the\\ncorrect electron cusp (i.e. logarithmic derivative of −1/4\\nor−1/2 for parallel or anti-parallel spins, respectively, at\\nr= 0) and tends rapidly to 1 for r > r c. This function Jsr\\nmay be said to contain the short-range cusp behaviour\\nof the Coulomb scattering solution, since it represents\\n8',\n",

We do not use Savin’s ap-\\nproach, but rather directly modify the Rys quadrature\\napproach of Dupuis, Rys, and King [25], to obtain ma-\\ntrix elements for the interaction Verfin place of those for\\n1/r12. To evaluate two-electron integrals for the pseudo-\\ninteraction Vps, we use the form given in Eq. 3. This in-\\nvolves the evaluation of integrals with the interaction Verf\\nand a sum of Gaussian terms. In codes (e.g. the ARGOS\\ncode [31]) which use the Rys quadrature [25] approach for\\nthe evaluation of two-electron integrals with the Coulomb\\ninteraction, these Gaussian terms are already evaluated\\nin an intermediate stage and may be used in the present\\ncontext.\\nLet us deﬁne two-electron integrals of the Coulomb\\ninteraction as\\n(φiφj|1\\nr12|φkφl)\\n≡/integraldisplay/integraldisplay\\nφi(r1)φj(r1)1\\nr12φk(r2)φl(r2)dr1dr2,\\nfor Gaussian basis functions,\\nφi(r) = exp( −ai|r−Ri|2)/productdisplay\\nx,y,z(x−Xi)nxi.The Rys scheme represents the 1 /r12term in Gaussian\\nintegral form, to obtain:\\n(φiφj|1\\nr12|φkφl) =2√π/integraldisplay∞\\n0du(φiφj|exp(−u2r2\\n12)|φkφl).\\n(D1)\\nThis integral is then transformed to an integral over the\\nvariable t, where t2=u2/(ρ+u2) and 1 /ρ= 1/(ai+\\naj) + 1/(ak+al):\\n(φiφj|1\\nr12|φkφl) =/integraldisplay1\\n0PL(t)exp(−Xt2)dt , (D2)\\nwhere PLis a polynomial and X=ρ|rA−rB|2.

This\\nchanges the upper limit of integration in the variable t\\nfrom 1 to tc= 1//radicalbig\\n1 +ρr2cin Eq. D2.
