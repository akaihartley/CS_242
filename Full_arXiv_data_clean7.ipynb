The exact\\\\nmany-electron wave function for this smooth eï¬ective inter action has no cusp at zero electron-\\\\nelectron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo c alculations for He and Be atoms,\\\\nboth with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and wi th the smooth eï¬ective electron-electron\\\\ninteraction. We ï¬nd that convergence of the CI expansion of t he wave function for the smooth\\\\nelectron-electron interaction is not signiï¬cantly improv ed compared with that for the divergent\\\\nCoulomb interaction for energy diï¬erences on the order of 1 m Hartree. This shows that, contrary to\\\\npopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical\\\\naccuracy, for CI calculations.\\\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\\\nThe primary diï¬culty in solving the SchrÂ¨ odinger equa-\\\\ntion for many-electron systems arises from the presence\\\\nof the electron-electron interaction, which results in a\\\\nproblem non-separable in the electron coordinates. Con-\\\\nï¬guration interaction (CI) calculations use an expansion\\\\nof the many-body wave function in conï¬guration state\\\\nfunctions (CSF) given by spin coupled sums of determi-\\\\nnants built from single-particle orbitals. One of the cen-\\\\ntral diï¬culties for the convergence of the CI expansion\\\\nis thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb\\\\ninteraction at small electron-electron separations [1â10 ].\\\\nThe many-body wave function must have an appropriate\\\\ncusp at electron coalescences so that the inï¬nite Coulomb\\\\ninteraction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di-\\\\nvergence of the kinetic energy [11].\\\\nIt is often stated in the literature that failure of the\\\\nCI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp, i.e.\\\\nthe short-range part of the Coulomb hole, leads to a slow\\\\nconvergence in the energy with respect to the number\\\\nof CSFâs [3]. While this has been shown [2,5] in the\\\\nasymptotic regime (i.e. very large angular momentum l\\\\nand energy errors of the order of 10â6Hartree), it is not\\\\nclear that it applies in the practical regime (mHartree\\\\naccuracy) for multi-electron systems.\\\\nExplicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic dis-\\\\ntance (r 12methods) [12,4] or the use of correlated (gem-\\\\ninal) Gaussian basis functions [13] signiï¬cantly improve\\\\nthe convergence of a CI calculation. For the helium atom,\\\\nthe inclusion of r 12terms [5] yields an expansion in partial\\\\nwaves converging asymtotically as lâ6or better, instead\\\\nof a slow lâ3, where lis the maximum angular momentum\\\\nin the expansion. Baker et al.[14] also showed that using\\\\nbasis functions with the same analytic structure as the\\\\ntrue wave function (depending on powers and logarithms\\\\nofr12) leads to a reduced expansion length. The suc-\\\\ncess of methods explicitly including r12terms has beenattributed to their correct description of the short-range\\\\npart of the interaction.\\\\nA completely diï¬erent point of view, taken by Gilbert\\\\nin 1963 [15], is that the diï¬culty of CI wave functions in\\\\ndescribing short-range eï¬ects of the cusp are energeticall y\\\\nunimportant and that the beneï¬t of the explicitly corre-\\\\nlated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole, with a\\\\nsize on the order of the atomic orbitals, is much easier to\\\\ndescribe in terms of interelectronic coordinates. Gilbert âs\\\\nsuggestion appears to have received little attention and\\\\nthe idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and\\\\nremoving the cusp altogether will automatically lead to\\\\nan improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter-\\\\nature [16,9]. However, no systematic studies of the eï¬ect\\\\nof the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level\\\\nof interest for chemical accuracy (1 mHartree for total\\\\nenergies) have been presented.\\\\nIn this paper, we explore whether a signiï¬cant im-\\\\nprovement in the convergence of the CI expansion is\\\\nobtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one\\\\nwhich has a smooth and ï¬nite electron-electron interac-\\\\ntion (pseudo-interaction) at short distances and, conse-\\\\nquently, smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps.\\\\nSurprisingly, in calculations for the He and Be atoms,\\\\nwe ï¬nd that removing the divergence of the Coulomb\\\\npotential at electron-electron coalescences does not sig-\\\\nniï¬cantly reduce the length of the CI expansion, thereby\\\\nsubstantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert [15]\\\\nthat the slow convergence should be attributed to dif-\\\\nï¬culties in describing, not the interelectron cusp, but\\\\nthe intermediate-range electronic correlation. The poor\\\\ntreatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is\\\\nnot a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on\\\\nthe total energy. To further conï¬rm this result, we calcu-\\\\nlate the energy within quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for\\\\nthe true electron-electron interaction with accurate wave\\\\nfunctions which explicitly contain interelectronic coord i-\\\\nnates, and then deliberately remove the short-range cor-\\\\n1', 'relation term related to the cusp, keeping other parts\\\\nof the wave function unchanged. We ï¬nd that the re-\\\\nmoval of the cusp has a very small eï¬ect on the vari-\\\\national energy. Finally, we demonstrate that the con-\\\\nvergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of\\\\nangular momentum in the range practical for many ap-\\\\nplications ( l <6) is largely unaï¬ected by the smoothing\\\\nof the electron cusps. Therefore, the angular momentum\\\\nconvergence numerically observed by other authors [7] is\\\\nrelated to problems associated with intermediate range\\\\ncorrelations, not the cusp region as such.\\\\nIn Sec. II, we describe the pseudopotential used for\\\\nthe electron-electron interaction and brieï¬y present the\\\\nQMC and CI methods. In Sec. III, we report the QMC\\\\nand CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and\\\\npseudo electron interaction. In Appendices A and B,\\\\nwe discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the\\\\nelectron pseudo-interaction, and in Appendix C we deï¬ne\\\\na short-range correlation term which can be associated\\\\nwith it. In Appendix D, we brieï¬y discuss the evaluation\\\\nof two-electron integrals for the pseudo-interaction.\\\\nII. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\\\\nA. Electron-electron Pseudo-interaction\\\\nWhen modifying the short-distance electron-electron\\\\ninteraction, we wish to keep the intermediate- and long-\\\\nrange correlation properties of the many-body eigen-\\\\nstates unchanged. This will allow us to isolate systemati-\\\\ncally the eï¬ects of the short-range cusp-like behaviour in\\\\nthe wave function. To achieve this, our new (smooth) in-\\\\nteraction should ideally have electron-electron scatteri ng\\\\nproperties identical to the true interaction for all ener-\\\\ngies. If this were the case, all many-electron eigenvalues\\\\nwould be identical for both interactions. While this ideal\\\\ncannot be exactly realized, we expect that a potential\\\\nwith the same scattering properties as the true interac-\\\\ntion over a suï¬ciently wide range of scattering energies\\\\nwill give many-electron eigenvalues very close to the true\\\\nones.\\\\nThis goal for electron-electron scattering is analogous\\\\nto the problem of electron-ion scattering addressed in the\\\\nwell-established pseudopotential method [17]. In that ap-\\\\nproach, the aim is to produce a smooth electron-ion po-\\\\ntential which reproduces the single-particle eigenvalues\\\\nof the true system over a range of energies, and has the\\\\nsame single-particle wave functions outside some suitably\\\\nchosen cut-oï¬ radius rc. Such pseudopotentials are gen-\\\\nerated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a\\\\nhigh level of accuracy in molecules and solids. In solids,\\\\nthe smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con-\\\\nvergence of plane-wave expansions for single-particle or-\\\\nbitals [18].\\\\nFollowing the success of norm-conserving pseudopo-\\\\ntential methods in the context of the electron-ion scat-0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\\\\nr (a.u.)0246810interaction energy (Hartree)Vps interaction\\\\nVerf interaction\\\\nCoulomb interaction\\\\nFIG. 1. Norm-conserving electron pseudo-interaction\\\\n(solid line) and smooth interaction Verf(dashed line), each\\\\nwith a cut-oï¬ radius rc= 0.25 a.u. (indicated by a vertical\\\\ndotted line), and the true 1 /rinteraction (dash-dot line), as\\\\nfunctions of the electron separation r.\\\\ntering problem, we generate a norm-conserving pseudo-\\\\ninteraction for the two-electron scattering problem,\\\\nwhich will replace the true e2/relectron-electron interac-\\\\ntion inside a cut-oï¬ radius rc. Since the electron-electron\\\\ninteraction is repulsive and has no bound states for an\\\\nisolated pair of electrons, we use, with some minor mod-\\\\niï¬cations, the generalized norm-conserving method de-\\\\nvised by Hamann [19] to generate pseudopotentials for\\\\nelectron-ion interactions at unbound, scattering state en -\\\\nergies. The numerical details of this approach are pre-\\\\nsented in Appendix A.\\\\nIn Fig. 1, we show a pseudo-interaction potential Vps\\\\ngenerated by this approach, along with the true e2/rin-\\\\nteraction and a smooth but not norm-conserving inter-\\\\naction, Verf(r) =e2erf(r/rc)/r, as used by Savin and\\\\ncoworkers [20] in a diï¬erent context. In Appendix B, the\\\\naccuracy of such scattering potentials in reproducing the\\\\nexact eigenstate energies is analyzed qualitatively using\\\\nï¬rst-order perturbation theory. In Appendix C, we de-\\\\nï¬ne a short-range inter-electronic correlation term, whic h\\\\ncan be directly related to the replacement of the divergent\\\\nCoulomb interaction with a smooth norm-conserving in-\\\\nteraction.\\\\nB. Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations\\\\nWe employ QMC methods to determine accurate en-\\\\nergies both for the Coulomb and the pseudo-interaction.\\\\nThe wave functions Î¨ used in QMC are of the form given\\\\nin Ref. [21] and explicitly depend on the inter-electronic\\\\n2', 'coordinates. They include parameterized terms to de-\\\\nscribe electron-nucleus, electron-electron and electron -\\\\nelectron-nucleus correlation, as follows:\\\\nÎ¨ =/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay\\\\nndnDâ\\\\nnDâ\\\\nn/parenrightBigg\\\\nJ(ri, rj, rij). (1)\\\\nDâ\\\\nnand Dâ\\\\nnare the Slater determinants of single particle\\\\norbitals for the spin-up and down electrons, respectively,\\\\nandJis a Jastrow factor of the form,\\\\nJ(ri, rj, rij) =/productdisplay\\\\niexp (Ai)/productdisplay\\\\nijexp (Bij)/productdisplay\\\\nijexp(Pij),(2)\\\\nwhere Ais an electron-nuclear term (which could be\\\\nomitted if a suï¬ciently large single particle basis were\\\\nused in constructing the determinantal part), Bis an\\\\nelectron-electron term incorporating the cusp at small\\\\nrij, and Pis a smooth function of the electron coordi-\\\\nnates, riandrj, as discussed in detail in Ref. [21]. For\\\\nthe pseudo-interaction calculations, the Bterm is omit-\\\\nted. The parameters in the determinant and Jastrow\\\\nfactor are optimized within QMC using the variance min-\\\\nimisation method [22] and the accuracy is tested at the\\\\nvariational level. The wave function is then used in dif-\\\\nfusion Monte Carlo (DMC), which produces the best en-\\\\nergy within the ï¬xed-node approximation (i.e. the lowest-\\\\nenergy state with the same nodes as the trial wave func-\\\\ntion).\\\\nFor a given interaction, this method yields the ex-\\\\nact eigenvalue (within statistical sampling noise) for the\\\\nground state of the He isoelectronic series since the sin-\\\\nglet ground state wave function of a two-electron system\\\\nis nodeless. For He, only one determinant is used in the\\\\nwave function. For the Be atom, the 2s and 2p conï¬gura-\\\\ntions are included in the determinantal part of the wave\\\\nfunction and DMC gives the best energy subject to the\\\\nï¬xed-node condition. To isolate the eï¬ect of the pseudo-\\\\ninteraction from the ï¬xed-node approximation, we keep\\\\nthe nodal structure of the wave function ï¬xed while mod-\\\\nifying the electron-electron interaction.\\\\nC. Conï¬guration Interaction Calculations\\\\nThe CI calculations are performed using the Monte\\\\nCarlo conï¬guration interaction (MCCI) method [23,24].\\\\nIn a MCCI calculation, a coeï¬cient threshold cminis de-\\\\nï¬ned, conï¬gurations are randomly generated, and, after\\\\na variational calculation, coeï¬cients of magnitude be-\\\\nlowcminare rejected. This procedure is repeated until\\\\na desired degree of convergence in the CI calculation is\\\\nachieved. A full CI (FCI) calculation can be obtained for\\\\ncmin= 0. The fact that the MCCI procedure does not\\\\nrely on a pre-selection of CSFâs makes it well-suited for\\\\nour study: the dynamical selection of conï¬gurations al-\\\\nlows for rejection of CSFâs which may no longer be needed\\\\nwith the smooth electron interaction.For use in the CI approach, the pseudo-interaction Vps\\\\nis represented (in Hartree atomic units) as a sum of the\\\\nsmooth function VerfplusnGGaussian terms, as follows:\\\\nVps(r) =erf(r/rc)\\\\nr+nG/summationdisplay\\\\ni=1ciexp(âdir2). (3)\\\\nThis reproduces the 1 /rtail of the Coulomb interaction\\\\nand the smooth, ï¬nite form of the pseudo-interaction at\\\\nshort distances. The parameters cianddiare found by\\\\nleast-squares ï¬tting (for radii r <3rc) to the numerical\\\\npotential, generated as described in Appendix A. For\\\\nthe CI results presented below, the potential was ï¬tted\\\\nusing nG= 9. QMC calculations of the He atom energy\\\\nwith the numerical potential and with the ï¬tted potential\\\\nshow a negligible diï¬erence (less than 0 .02 mHartree for\\\\nall values of rc<1 a.u.).\\\\nEvaluation of the pseudo-interaction Vps(r) can be im-\\\\nplemented in codes for Gaussian integral calculation since\\\\nit is possible to compute the two-body matrix elements\\\\nboth of exp( âd r2) and erf( r/rc)/rin the CI basis. Ma-\\\\ntrix elements of the interaction erf( r/rc)/rfor all s-type\\\\nbasis functions have already been given in Ref. [20]. For\\\\nboth types of interaction, a simple modiï¬cation to the\\\\nintegral codes is possible if the standard two-electron in-\\\\ntegrals are calculated using the method of Rys quadra-\\\\nture [25]. Details of two-body integral evaluation with\\\\nthe modiï¬ed form of the electron interaction are given in\\\\nAppendix D.\\\\nIII. He AND Be ATOMIC ENERGIES WITH\\\\nPSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\\\\nTo test the impact of the interelectron cusp on the en-\\\\nergy, we calculate the total energies of He and Be atoms,\\\\nreplacing the true 1 /relectron interaction with the norm-\\\\nconserving pseudo-interaction Vps(r), generated for var-\\\\nious values of the cut-oï¬ radius rc. For comparison,\\\\nwe also present results for the smooth but not norm-\\\\nconserving potential Verf(r) = erf( r/rc)/r. The results\\\\nin this section are obtained from QMC and CI calcula-\\\\ntions.\\\\nA. Ground State of the He atom\\\\nIn Fig. 2, we show the singlet ground state energies of\\\\nthe He atom calculated with a norm-conserving electron-\\\\nelectron interaction Vpsgenerated as in Sec. II, for various\\\\nvalues of the cut-oï¬ radius rc. The values obtained from\\\\nQMC (exact) calculations are shown. We also plot the\\\\nenergies calculated using the Verf(r) interaction. The hor-\\\\nizontal line indicates the exact energy E0=â2.903724\\\\nHartree for the true Coulomb interaction [26].\\\\nThe calculated QMC energies for VpsandVerfin\\\\nFig. 2 are ï¬tted with polynomial expansions of the form:\\\\n3', '0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\\\nrc (a.u.)â2.96â2.94â2.92â2.90E (Hartree)\\\\nCuspless Î¨\\\\nVps interaction\\\\nVerf interactionHe\\\\nFIG. 2.

As discussed\\\\nin Appendix B, any potential which diï¬ers from the ex-\\\\nact 1/rinteraction would be expected, from ï¬rst order\\\\nperturbation theory, to converge at least quadratically in\\\\nrcto the exact energy E0for small rc. Since Verfis not\\\\nexplicitly constructed to eliminate ï¬rst order errors in\\\\nVerf(r)â1/r, quadratic convergence is seen for Verfand\\\\nthe ï¬tting parameters are: a=â0.3279, b=â0.3839,\\\\nc= 0.6758, d=â0.2622, and e= 0. On the other\\\\nhand, the norm-conserving pseudo-interaction construc-\\\\ntion of Sec. II A explicitly ensures that the ï¬rst-order\\\\nperturbation correction to the energy is zero. The He\\\\nground state energy as a function of rcusing Vpscan\\\\nindeed be ï¬tted without the quadratic term, and even\\\\nthe cubic term proves to be small, the polynomial coef-\\\\nï¬cients being: a= 0,b= 0.0188, c=â0.1023, d= 0,\\\\nande= 0.0280. For He, the energies obtained using\\\\nVps(r) are within 1 mHartree of the energy computed\\\\nwith the true Coulomb interaction for values of rc<0.4\\\\na.u. Since the typical electron-electron distance in the\\\\nHe ground state is of the order of 1 a.u., these results in-\\\\ndicate that the ï¬rst peak of the electron pair-distribution\\\\nfunction provides a good measure of how large a cut-oï¬\\\\nradius rcmay be used to obtain accurate total energies\\\\nwithVps(r):rcshould be approximately half the radius\\\\nat which this ï¬rst peak occurs. The same criterion for\\\\nthe largest allowed rcvalue was found to hold for other\\\\nsystems (not shown), viz. the He triplet state, the He\\\\nisoelectronic series, and multi-electron atoms. In a qual-itative way, this condition is similar to the criterion used\\\\nin the generation of electron-ion pseudopotentials, where\\\\nthe cut-oï¬ radius is chosen to be inside the peak of the\\\\nvalence electron density.\\\\nAlso shown in Fig. 2 are the variational energies (with\\\\nthe true Coulomb electron-electron interaction) obtained\\\\nfor the He ground state by removing the electron cusps\\\\nfrom the accurate trial wave function which was deter-\\\\nmined by variance minimization for use in the DMC cal-\\\\nculations, as speciï¬ed in Eq. C1. This trial wave function\\\\nincludes considerable variational freedom in the interele c-\\\\ntronic terms and obtains 100% of the correlation energy.\\\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, removal of the cusp out to radii\\\\nof 0.5 a.u. causes little degradation of the quality of the\\\\nenergy obtained with this wave function. Thus the suc-\\\\ncess of interelectronic terms in obtaining good variationa l\\\\nenergies is not primarily due to their description of the\\\\nshort-range cusp behaviour.\\\\nThis trend is further borne out when we look at\\\\nthe convergence of partial CI expansions within a given\\\\nsingle-particle basis set for the MCCI method. The CI\\\\ncalculations were performed with the correlation consis-\\\\ntent polarized valence double-zeta (cc-pVDZ), triple-zet a\\\\n(cc-pVTZ), quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) and quintuple-\\\\nzeta (cc-pV5Z) basis sets of Dunning [27] with the elec-\\\\ntron interaction Vpsfor various values of rc. All four\\\\nbasis sets show similar behaviour and we present only\\\\nthe cc-pVQZ results in detail. Table I shows the correla-\\\\ntion energy obtained as a function of cut-oï¬ radius rcfor\\\\nvarious values of the expansion coeï¬cient threshold cmin.\\\\nThe full CI result is obtained when cmin= 0.0. For larger\\\\nvalues of the cut-oï¬ radius rc(upper rows of table), the\\\\ntotal correlation energy is smaller, as the variation of the\\\\ninteraction Vpsbecomes smaller around the typical sepa-\\\\nration distance of the electrons. However, the fraction of\\\\nthe correlation energy which is recovered at a given CI\\\\nthreshold level cmindepends little on the value of rc.\\\\nFig. 3 shows the number of CSFâs in the CI expan-\\\\nsion as a function of cut-oï¬ radius rcfor various values\\\\nof the expansion coeï¬cient threshold cmin. For values of\\\\ncmin>3Ã10â2, one is quickly reduced to a few CSFâs\\\\nand ï¬nally to the Hartree-Fock solution. As with the cor-\\\\nrelation energies, for a given threshold cmin, the number\\\\nof CSFâs shows relatively little change for values of rcbe-\\\\ntween 0 and 0.95. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that\\\\nthe typical electron-electron separation is 1 a.u. and that\\\\na cut-oï¬ radius rc= 0.95 represents a very smooth inter-\\\\naction. Thus, removal of electron cusps does not result\\\\nin a signiï¬cant reduction in the number of contributing\\\\nconï¬gurations in the CI expansion.\\\\nWe next demonstrate that removal of the electron cusp\\\\ndoes not signiï¬cantly change the convergence properties\\\\nof CI expansions as the highest angular momentum quan-\\\\ntum number is increased in the single particle basis sets.\\\\nIn Fig. 4, FCI energies for He are displayed against in-\\\\ncreasing basis set size in the correlation consistent serie s\\\\nfrom Dunning, and hence increasing angular momentum\\\\nnumber in the basis.

Ground State of the Be atom\\\\nThe qualitative nature of the CI energy convergence\\\\nseen in the previous section is not special to the He\\\\natom.

Because of the\\\\nmuch smaller radius of the 1s orbital in Be, compared to\\\\nHe, the energetically appropriate cut-oï¬ radius rcfor the\\\\npseudo-interaction is substantially smaller.

C1) from the accurate trial wave function which\\\\nwas determined by variance minimization for use in the\\\\nDMC calculations. This trial wave function includes in-\\\\nterelectronic terms and obtains 99.5% of the correlation\\\\nenergy. Removal of the cusp causes signiï¬cant degrada-\\\\ntion of the quality of the wave function only for rc>0.3\\\\natomic units, which is comparable to the typical sepa-\\\\nration of the 1s electrons.

CONCLUSIONS\\\\nIn this paper we have directly explored the eï¬ect\\\\nof the electron cusp on the convergence of the en-\\\\nergy for CI wave functions. To do so, we introduced\\\\na ï¬ctitious electron-electron interaction which, unlike\\\\nthe true Coulomb potential, does not diverge at elec-\\\\ntron coalescences and therefore has many-body eigen-\\\\nfunctions which are smooth there. The smooth poten-\\\\ntial is obtained by a method analogous to the well-\\\\nestablished treatment of electron-ion interactions with\\\\n6', '0 0.1 0.2\\\\nrc (a.u.)110102103104number of CSFâs\\\\ncmin = 0.0001\\\\ncmin = 0.001\\\\ncmin = 0.01TZP\\\\nANO\\\\nFIG. 6.

These give\\\\nscattering properties very similar to the true potential\\\\nand improve the convergence of plane-wave expansions\\\\nfor single-particle wave functions. By analogy, one might\\\\nexpect that a similar treatment of the electron-electron\\\\ninteraction would improve the convergence of CI expan-\\\\nsions.\\\\nFor the He and Be atoms, we have compared the CI\\\\nexpansions of wave functions for the true, Coulomb inter-\\\\naction and for smooth pseudo-interactions between the\\\\nelectrons. We have also compared the variational en-\\\\nergies of highly accurate wave functions containing r12\\\\nterms, where the cusp condition is exactly satisï¬ed, with\\\\nthe energy for the same wave functions, from which the\\\\ncusp has been deliberately removed out to a given radius.\\\\nThe main result of our study is that a description of\\\\nthe electron cusp as such is nota limiting factor in cal-\\\\nculating correlation eï¬ects with conï¬guration interactio n\\\\nmethods at the mHartree level of accuracy. We are led\\\\nto this conclusion since the replacement of the diver-\\\\ngent Coulomb interaction with a ï¬nite interaction leaves\\\\nthe convergence properties largely unchanged. The slow\\\\nconvergence of CI expansions in this energy range must\\\\nbe attributed to medium-range correlations, which are\\\\npresent for both types of electron interaction. The results\\\\nobtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate\\\\nvariational wave functions support this conclusion, show-\\\\ning that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically\\\\nimportant. This is found, even when cusp-like behaviour\\\\nis removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec-\\\\ntronic separation.\\\\nWhen describing correlation eï¬ects with explicit r12\\\\nmethods, it is a mistaken notion to assign the improve-\\\\nment in convergence to their ability to describe the short-range cusp. Rather, the improvement in convergence at\\\\nthe mHartree level must be understood in terms of a\\\\nbetter description of medium-range correlations when ex-\\\\npressed in interelectronic coordinates. This fact must be\\\\nconsidered when developing theoretical treatments of the\\\\nelectronic correlation problem.\\\\nV. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\\\nWe wish to thank D. R.

In Hartree atomic units, the\\\\ninteraction potential is V(r) = 1/rand the reduced mass\\\\nis 1/2. The radial SchrÂ¨ odinger equation for the relative\\\\nmotion of two electrons is then\\\\nâd2ul\\\\ndr2+/parenleftbiggl(l+ 1)\\\\nr2+ (VâÇ«l)/parenrightbigg\\\\nul= 0, (A1)\\\\nwhere ul(r) isrtimes the wave function in the relative\\\\ncoordinates, with angular momentum land energy Ç«l(the\\\\nkinetic energy of the separated electrons in the centre of\\\\nmass frame).\\\\nIn the generation of a pseudopotential, the true po-\\\\ntential and pseudopotential become identical outside a\\\\nsuitably chosen cut-oï¬ radius rcand are constructed to\\\\nhave identical scattering phase shifts and energy deriva-\\\\ntive of the phase shift at a reference energy Ç«l. A smooth\\\\npseudo wave function ups(r) is generated numerically to\\\\nensure ânorm-conservationâ, i.e. ups(Râ) =ul(Râ) and\\\\n/integraldisplayRâ\\\\n0ups(r)2dr=/integraldisplayRâ\\\\n0ul(r)2dr , (A2)\\\\nfor all Râ>> r c. In practice, we choose Rââ¼2.5rc,\\\\nas in Ref. [19]. Given ups, a smooth, ï¬nite pseudopo-\\\\ntential Vpsis generated by inversion of the SchrÂ¨ odinger\\\\nEq. A1 for r < R â, with ulandVsubstituted by upsand\\\\nVps, respectively. We follow the steps exactly as given in\\\\n7', 'Sec. II of Ref. [19], except where the reduced mass en-\\\\nters in the ï¬nal inversion, slightly modifying Eq. 12 of\\\\nHamannâs work.\\\\nIn the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, dif-\\\\nferent scattering potentials are often generated for diï¬er -\\\\nent values of the angular momentum l. The full many-\\\\nbody wave function is anti-symmetric with respect to ex-\\\\nchange of any two electrons. Thus, if the two electrons\\\\nhave parallel spin, the orbital part of the wave function\\\\nmust have odd parity and the allowed angular momentum\\\\nlmust be odd. Thus, the dominant parallel-spin scat-\\\\ntering has l= 1. For singlet (anti-parallel) scattering,\\\\nthe orbital part is symmetric and lmust be even, with\\\\ndominant allowed angular momentum l= 0. Following\\\\nthe usual pseudopotential approach, we might then ex-\\\\npect to generate a parallel-spin scattering potential usin g\\\\nl= 1 and an anti-parallel-spin scattering potential using\\\\nl= 0. In practice, we ï¬nd that the l= 0 potential gives\\\\ngood scattering for both angular momenta and the use\\\\nof separate parallel- and anti-parallel-spin potentials i s\\\\nunnecessary.\\\\nSince Ç«lis positive, the wave function will oscillate for\\\\nlarge r, and if a node occurs for r < R â, the inver-\\\\nsion of the SchrÂ¨ odinger equation will fail. Thus, the joint\\\\nrequirements, that rcbe suï¬ciently large to produce a\\\\nsmooth pseudo-interaction and that Râ>â¼2.5rc, eï¬ec-\\\\ntively limit the maximum reference energy Ç«lat which\\\\nthe pseudo-interaction construction is possible.\\\\nWe ï¬nd that the pseudo-interaction is transferable (i.e.\\\\nhas very similar scattering strength to the true interac-\\\\ntion) for energies over a wide range about the reference\\\\nenergy Ç«l, as found previously for electron-ion pseudopo-\\\\ntentials. In particular, we ï¬nd that transferability is bes t\\\\nfor energies less than the reference energy at which the\\\\npseudopotential was generated. This would suggest that\\\\nthe best reference energy to use is the largest energy\\\\ncompatible with the procedure for inversion of the radial\\\\nSchrÂ¨ odinger equation, a choice conï¬rmed by calculations\\\\nof many-body eigenstates using pseudo-interaction po-\\\\ntentials generated with diï¬erent values of the reference\\\\nenergy.\\\\nAPPENDIX B: FIRST ORDER PERTURBATION\\\\nANALYSIS OF PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\\\\nIn this Appendix, we consider the ï¬rst-order error\\\\nin the energy expected for a typical, arbitrary smooth\\\\nelectron-electron potential which is equal to the exact in-\\\\nteraction 1 /routside some (adjustable) cut-oï¬ radius rc.\\\\nWe will assume that the potential is (at least approxi-\\\\nmately) of the form\\\\nVrc(r) =1\\\\nrcU(r/rc) (B1)\\\\nwhere U(r/rc) is some universal function independent\\\\nofrc.

However,\\\\nfor an arbitrary smooth interaction (such as Verf),Kwill\\\\nnot be zero.\\\\nAPPENDIX C: SHORT-RANGE CORRELATION\\\\nTERM OBTAINED FROM NORM-CONSERVING\\\\nPOTENTIAL\\\\nIn the generation of the norm-conserving potential dis-\\\\ncussed in Appendix A, we obtained a pseudo wave func-\\\\ntionups(r), which is a solution to the radial SchrÂ¨ odinger\\\\nequation at the scattering energy Ç«lfor the pseudo-\\\\ninteraction, and the wave function ul(r), which is the\\\\ncorresponding solution for the true Coulomb interaction.\\\\nThe ratio Jsr=ul/upsof these two functions has the\\\\ncorrect electron cusp (i.e. logarithmic derivative of â1/4\\\\norâ1/2 for parallel or anti-parallel spins, respectively, at\\\\nr= 0) and tends rapidly to 1 for r > r c. This function Jsr\\\\nmay be said to contain the short-range cusp behaviour\\\\nof the Coulomb scattering solution, since it represents\\\\n8', 'the diï¬erence between the scattering wave function for\\\\nthe divergent potential and that for the ï¬nite pseudo-\\\\ninteraction.\\\\nMoreover, if Î¨( r1, . . . ,rN) is a many-electron wave\\\\nfunction (e.g. one which has inter-electronic coordinates\\\\nrijexplicitly included) with the correct electron cusps,\\\\nthe function\\\\nÎ¨s= Î¨(r1, . . .,rN)//productdisplay\\\\ni<jJsr(rij) (C1)\\\\nis smooth at electron coalescences but has very similar\\\\nelectron correlations for rij> rc. The wave function\\\\nÎ¨shas the electron cusp behaviour of the original wave\\\\nfunction Î¨ removed inside the cut-oï¬ radius rc, but is\\\\notherwise the same as Î¨. Thus, the energy diï¬erence\\\\n/angbracketleftÎ¨s|H|Î¨s/angbracketright â /angbracketleftÎ¨|H|Î¨/angbracketrightis a good measure of the energy\\\\ncost of removing the electron cusp behaviour for r <\\\\nrcfrom a correlated wave function, while keeping other\\\\naspects of the wave function (e.g. any beneï¬ts there may\\\\nbe to the inclusion of inter-electronic coordinates in the\\\\nform of the trial function) unchanged.\\\\nAPPENDIX D: EVALUATION OF\\\\nTWO-ELECTRON GAUSSIAN INTEGRALS\\\\nWITH PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\\\\nIn this Appendix, we give details of the evaluation of\\\\ntwo-electron Gaussian basis set integrals for the electron\\\\ninteractions, VerfandVps, and their incorporation into\\\\nexisting electron integral programs.\\\\nFor the interaction Verf, the necessary modiï¬cation of\\\\ntwo-electron integrals for all s-type basis functions have\\\\nbeen given by Savin [20]. We do not use Savinâs ap-\\\\nproach, but rather directly modify the Rys quadrature\\\\napproach of Dupuis, Rys, and King [25], to obtain ma-\\\\ntrix elements for the interaction Verfin place of those for\\\\n1/r12. To evaluate two-electron integrals for the pseudo-\\\\ninteraction Vps, we use the form given in Eq. 3. This in-\\\\nvolves the evaluation of integrals with the interaction Verf\\\\nand a sum of Gaussian terms. In codes (e.g. the ARGOS\\\\ncode [31]) which use the Rys quadrature [25] approach for\\\\nthe evaluation of two-electron integrals with the Coulomb\\\\ninteraction, these Gaussian terms are already evaluated\\\\nin an intermediate stage and may be used in the present\\\\ncontext.\\\\nLet us deï¬ne two-electron integrals of the Coulomb\\\\ninteraction as\\\\n(ÏiÏj|1\\\\nr12|ÏkÏl)\\\\nâ¡/integraldisplay/integraldisplay\\\\nÏi(r1)Ïj(r1)1\\\\nr12Ïk(r2)Ïl(r2)dr1dr2,\\\\nfor Gaussian basis functions,\\\\nÏi(r) = exp( âai|râRi|2)/productdisplay\\\\nx,y,z(xâXi)nxi.The Rys scheme represents the 1 /r12term in Gaussian\\\\nintegral form, to obtain:\\\\n(ÏiÏj|1\\\\nr12|ÏkÏl) =2âÏ/integraldisplayâ\\\\n0du(ÏiÏj|exp(âu2r2\\\\n12)|ÏkÏl).\\\\n(D1)\\\\nThis integral is then transformed to an integral over the\\\\nvariable t, where t2=u2/(Ï+u2) and 1 /Ï= 1/(ai+\\\\naj) + 1/(ak+al):\\\\n(ÏiÏj|1\\\\nr12|ÏkÏl) =/integraldisplay1\\\\n0PL(t)exp(âXt2)dt , (D2)\\\\nwhere PLis a polynomial and X=Ï|rAârB|2.

na Department of Physics andb NMRC University College Cork Ireland n February   nThe eï¬ect of the electron electron cusp on the convergence o f conï¬guration interaction CI wave nfunctions is examined By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron ion interactions nan eï¬ective electron electron interaction is developed wh ich closely reproduces the scattering of nthe Coulomb interaction but is smooth and ï¬nite at zero elect ron electron separation The exact nmany electron wave function for this smooth eï¬ective inter action has no cusp at zero electron nelectron separation We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo c alculations for He and Be atoms nboth with the Coulomb electron electron interaction and wi th the smooth eï¬ective electron electron ninteraction We ï¬nd that convergence of the CI expansion of t he wave function for the smooth nelectron electron interaction is not signiï¬cantly improv ed compared with that for the divergent nCoulomb interaction for energy diï¬erences on the order of  m Hartree This shows that contrary to npopular belief description of the electron electron cusp is not a limiting factor to within chemical naccuracy for CI calculations nI INTRODUCTION nThe primary diï¬culty in solving the Schr odinger equa ntion for many electron systems arises from the presence nof the electron electron interaction which results in a nproblem non separable in the electron coordinates Con nï¬guration interaction CI calculations use an expansion nof the many body wave function in conï¬guration state nfunctions CSF given by spin coupled sums of determi nnants built from single particle orbitals One of the cen ntral diï¬culties for the convergence of the CI expansion nis thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb ninteraction at small electron electron separations   nThe many body wave function must have an appropriate ncusp at electron coalescences so that the inï¬nite Coulomb ninteraction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di nvergence of the kinetic energy  nIt is often stated in the literature that failure of the nCI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp i e nthe short range part of the Coulomb hole leads to a slow nconvergence in the energy with respect to the number nof CSF s  While this has been shown   in the nasymptotic regime i e very large angular momentum l nand energy errors of the order of  Hartree it is not nclear that it applies in the practical regime mHartree naccuracy for multi electron systems nExplicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic dis ntance r methods   or the use of correlated gem ninal Gaussian basis functions  signiï¬cantly improve nthe convergence of a CI calculation For the helium atom nthe inclusion of r terms  yields an expansion in partial nwaves converging asymtotically as l or better instead nof a slow l  where lis the maximum angular momentum nin the expansion Baker et al  also showed that using nbasis functions with the same analytic structure as the ntrue wave function depending on powers and logarithms nofr leads to a reduced expansion length The suc ncess of methods explicitly including rterms has beenattributed to their correct description of the short range npart of the interaction nA completely diï¬erent point of view taken by Gilbert nin   is that the diï¬culty of CI wave functions in ndescribing short range eï¬ects of the cusp are energeticall y nunimportant and that the beneï¬t of the explicitly corre nlated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole with a nsize on the order of the atomic orbitals is much easier to ndescribe in terms of interelectronic coordinates Gilbert s nsuggestion appears to have received little attention and nthe idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and nremoving the cusp altogether will automatically lead to nan improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter nature   However no systematic studies of the eï¬ect nof the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level nof interest for chemical accuracy  mHartree for total nenergies have been presented nIn this paper we explore whether a signiï¬cant im nprovement in the convergence of the CI expansion is nobtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one nwhich has a smooth and ï¬nite electron electron interac ntion pseudo interaction at short distances and conse nquently smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps nSurprisingly in calculations for the He and Be atoms nwe ï¬nd that removing the divergence of the Coulomb npotential at electron electron coalescences does not sig nniï¬cantly reduce the length of the CI expansion thereby nsubstantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert  nthat the slow convergence should be attributed to dif nï¬culties in describing not the interelectron cusp but nthe intermediate range electronic correlation The poor ntreatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is nnot a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on nthe total energy To further conï¬rm this result we calcu nlate the energy within quantum Monte Carlo QMC for nthe true electron electron interaction with accurate wave nfunctions which explicitly contain interelectronic coord i nnates and then deliberately remove the short range cor n relation term related to the cusp keeping other parts nof the wave function unchanged We ï¬nd that the re nmoval of the cusp has a very small eï¬ect on the vari national energy Finally we demonstrate that the con nvergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of nangular momentum in the range practical for many ap nplications l  is largely unaï¬ected by the smoothing nof the electron cusps Therefore the angular momentum nconvergence numerically observed by other authors  is nrelated to problems associated with intermediate range ncorrelations not the cusp region as such nIn Sec II we describe the pseudopotential used for nthe electron electron interaction and brieï¬y present the nQMC and CI methods In Sec III we report the QMC nand CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and npseudo electron interaction In Appendices A and B nwe discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the nelectron pseudo interaction and in Appendix C we deï¬ne na short range correlation term which can be associated nwith it In Appendix D we brieï¬y discuss the evaluation nof two electron integrals for the pseudo interaction nII COMPUTATIONAL METHODS nA Electron electron Pseudo interaction nWhen modifying the short distance electron electron ninteraction we wish to keep the intermediate and long nrange correlation properties of the many body eigen nstates unchanged This will allow us to isolate systemati ncally the eï¬ects of the short range cusp like behaviour in nthe wave function To achieve this our new smooth in nteraction should ideally have electron electron scatteri ng nproperties identical to the true interaction for all ener ngies If this were the case all many electron eigenvalues nwould be identical for both interactions While this ideal ncannot be exactly realized we expect that a potential nwith the same scattering properties as the true interac ntion over a suï¬ciently wide range of scattering energies nwill give many electron eigenvalues very close to the true nones nThis goal for electron electron scattering is analogous nto the problem of electron ion scattering addressed in the nwell established pseudopotential method  In that ap nproach the aim is to produce a smooth electron ion po ntential which reproduces the single particle eigenvalues nof the true system over a range of energies and has the nsame single particle wave functions outside some suitably nchosen cut oï¬ radius rc Such pseudopotentials are gen nerated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a nhigh level of accuracy in molecules and solids In solids nthe smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con nvergence of plane wave expansions for single particle or nbitals  nFollowing the success of norm conserving pseudopo ntential methods in the context of the electron ion scat             nr a u

ninteraction for the two electron scattering problem nwhich will replace the true e relectron electron interac ntion inside a cut oï¬ radius rc Since the electron electron ninteraction is repulsive and has no bound states for an nisolated pair of electrons we use with some minor mod niï¬cations the generalized norm conserving method de nvised by Hamann  to generate pseudopotentials for nelectron ion interactions at unbound scattering state en nergies The numerical details of this approach are pre nsented in Appendix A nIn Fig  we show a pseudo interaction potential Vps ngenerated by this approach along with the true e rin nteraction and a smooth but not norm conserving inter naction Verf r eerf r rc r as used by Savin and ncoworkers  in a diï¬erent context In Appendix B the naccuracy of such scattering potentials in reproducing the nexact eigenstate energies is analyzed qualitatively using nï¬rst order perturbation theory In Appendix C we de nï¬ne a short range inter electronic correlation term whic h ncan be directly related to the replacement of the divergent nCoulomb interaction with a smooth norm conserving in nteraction nB Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations nWe

conï¬gura ntions are included in the determinantal part of the wave nfunction and DMC gives the best energy subject to the nï¬xed node condition To isolate the eï¬ect of the pseudo ninteraction from the ï¬xed node approximation we keep nthe nodal structure of the wave function ï¬xed while mod nifying the electron electron interaction nC Conï¬guration Interaction Calculations nThe CI calculations are performed using the Monte nCarlo conï¬guration interaction MCCI method   nIn a MCCI calculation a coeï¬cient threshold cminis de nï¬ned conï¬gurations are randomly generated and

quadratic convergence is seen for Verfand nthe ï¬tting parameters are a   b   nc   d   and e  On the other nhand the norm conserving pseudo interaction construc ntion of Sec II A explicitly ensures that the ï¬rst order nperturbation correction to the energy is zero The He nground state energy as a function of rcusing Vpscan nindeed be ï¬tted without the quadratic term and even nthe cubic term proves to be small the polynomial coef nï¬cients being a  b   c   d  nande   For He the energies obtained using nVps r are within  mHartree of the energy computed nwith the true Coulomb interaction for values of rc   na u Since the typical electron electron distance in the nHe ground state is of the order of  a u these results in ndicate that the ï¬rst peak of the electron pair distribution nfunction provides a good measure of how large a cut oï¬ nradius rcmay be used to obtain accurate total energies nwithVps r rcshould be approximately half the radius nat which this ï¬rst peak occurs The same criterion for nthe largest allowed rcvalue was found to hold for other nsystems not shown viz the He triplet state the He nisoelectronic series and multi electron atoms In a qual itative way this condition is similar to the criterion used nin the generation of electron ion pseudopotentials where nthe cut oï¬ radius is chosen to be inside the peak of the nvalence electron density nAlso shown in Fig  are the variational energies with nthe true Coulomb electron electron interaction obtained nfor the He ground state by removing the electron cusps nfrom the accurate trial wave function which was deter nmined by variance minimization for use in the DMC cal nculations as speciï¬ed in Eq C This trial wave function nincludes considerable variational freedom in the interele c ntronic terms and obtains  of the correlation energy nAs can be seen in Fig  removal of the cusp out to radii nof   a u causes little degradation of the quality of the nenergy obtained with this wave function

introduced na ï¬ctitious electron electron interaction which unlike nthe true Coulomb potential does not diverge at elec ntron coalescences and therefore has many body eigen nfunctions which are smooth there The smooth poten ntial is obtained by a method analogous to the well nestablished treatment of electron ion interactions with n      nrc a u number of CSF s ncmin   ncmin   ncmin  TZP

single particle wave functions By analogy one might nexpect that a similar treatment of the electron electron ninteraction would improve the convergence of CI expan nsions nFor the He and Be atoms we have compared the CI nexpansions of wave functions for the true Coulomb inter naction and for smooth pseudo interactions between the nelectrons We have also compared the variational en nergies of highly accurate wave functions containing r nterms where the cusp condition is exactly satisï¬ed with nthe energy for the same wave functions from which the ncusp has been deliberately removed out to a given radius nThe main result of our study is that a description of nthe electron cusp as such is nota limiting factor in cal nculating correlation eï¬ects with conï¬guration interactio n nmethods at the mHartree level of accuracy We are led nto this conclusion since the replacement of the diver ngent Coulomb interaction with a ï¬nite interaction leaves nthe convergence properties largely unchanged The slow nconvergence of CI expansions in this energy range must nbe attributed to medium range correlations which are npresent for both types of electron interaction The results nobtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate nvariational wave functions support this conclusion show ning that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically nimportant This is found even when cusp like behaviour nis removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec ntronic separation nWhen describing correlation eï¬ects with explicit r nmethods it is a mistaken notion to assign the improve nment in convergence to their ability to describe the short range cusp Rather the improvement in convergence at nthe mHartree level must be understood in terms of a nbetter description of medium range correlations when ex npressed in interelectronic coordinates This fact must be nconsidered when developing theoretical treatments of the nelectronic correlation problem nV ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

ELECTRON nPSEUDO INTERACTIONS nThe procedure for constructing the electron pseudo ninteraction Vpsfollows Hamann s construction  of gen neralised norm conserving pseudopotentials for electron nion scattering with two modiï¬cations i Only two nparticles are involved in the generation of the electron nelectron pseudo interaction so that we do not need to in nclude screening potentials ii because we are solving the nscattering problem in the centre of mass frame of the elec ntrons and use the relative coordinate rof the electrons nthe mass of the electron is replaced by the reduced mass nfor the two electron system In Hartree atomic units the ninteraction potential is V r  rand the reduced mass nis   The radial Schr odinger equation for the relative nmotion of two electrons is then n dul

nters in the ï¬nal inversion slightly modifying Eq  of nHamann s work nIn the norm conserving pseudopotential approach dif nferent scattering potentials are often generated for diï¬er nent values of the angular momentum l The full many nbody wave function is anti symmetric with respect to ex nchange of any two electrons Thus if the two electrons nhave parallel spin the orbital part of the wave function nmust have odd parity and the allowed angular momentum nlmust be odd Thus the dominant parallel spin scat ntering has l  For singlet anti parallel scattering nthe orbital part is symmetric and lmust be even with ndominant allowed angular momentum l  Following nthe usual pseudopotential approach we might then ex npect to generate a parallel spin scattering potential usin g nl  and an anti parallel spin scattering potential using nl  In practice we ï¬nd that the l  potential gives ngood scattering for both angular momenta and the use nof separate parallel and anti parallel spin potentials i s nunnecessary nSince Ç«lis positive the wave function will oscillate for nlarge r and if a node occurs for r R the inver nsion of the Schr odinger equation will fail Thus the joint nrequirements that rcbe suï¬ciently large to produce a nsmooth pseudo interaction and that R  rc eï¬ec ntively limit the maximum reference energy Ç«lat which nthe pseudo interaction construction is possible nWe ï¬nd that the pseudo interaction is transferable i e nhas very similar scattering strength to the true interac ntion for energies over a wide range about the reference nenergy Ç«l as found previously for electron ion pseudopo ntentials In particular we ï¬nd that transferability is bes t nfor energies less than the reference energy at which the npseudopotential was generated This would suggest that nthe best reference energy to use is the largest energy ncompatible with the procedure for inversion of the radial nSchr odinger equation a choice conï¬rmed by calculations nof
